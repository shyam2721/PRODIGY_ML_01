Title: House Price Prediction

Description:
This project aims to predict house prices using machine learning techniques. Leveraging a dataset containing various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, and more, our model learns patterns to accurately estimate the price of houses. By utilizing advanced regression algorithms and data preprocessing techniques, we strive to build a robust predictive model capable of providing reliable estimates for prospective buyers, sellers, and real estate investors.

Key Features:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming raw data to ensure quality and consistency.
Feature Engineering: Extracting relevant features and creating new ones to enhance model performance.
Model Selection: Evaluating and comparing different regression algorithms to identify the most suitable one for the task.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing model parameters to improve prediction accuracy.
Evaluation Metrics: Utilizing metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to assess model performance.
Visualization: Visualizing insights from the dataset and model predictions to aid in understanding and interpretation.
Deployment: Providing a user-friendly interface or API for users to input house attributes and receive predicted prices.
This project serves as a valuable tool for individuals and organizations involved in the real estate industry, empowering them with actionable insights for decision-making processes. Whether you're a homebuyer looking for fair pricing guidance or a real estate professional seeking data-driven market analysis, our House Price Prediction project aims to cater to your needs effectively.
